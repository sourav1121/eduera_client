          Each Eduera course is created, owned and managed by the instructor(s).
          The foundation of each Eduera course are its lectures, which can
          include videos, slides, and text. In addition, instructors can add
          resources and various types of practice activities, as a way to
          enhance the learning experience of students.

          Eduera courses are entirely on-demand and they can be accessed from
          several different devices and platforms, including a desktop, laptop,
          and our mobile app. After you enroll in a course, you can access it by
          clicking on the course link you will receive in your confirmation
          email (provided youâ€™re logged into your Eduera account). You can also
          begin the course by logging in and navigating to your My learning page
          (which is not implemented yet :P).
